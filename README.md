## Installation

### Binary
- Download the binary from the releases page.

- Run `./portal` and visit `localhost:9000`

### Docker

### Running the crawler

The crawler runs N workers and goes through all the manifest URLs in the database and updates their contents if they have changed (based on the Last-Updated header) within the interval specified in the config.
